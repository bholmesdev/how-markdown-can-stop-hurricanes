## What we're talking about

## Avoid greenwashing

> misleading or deceptive publicity disseminated by an organization so as to present an environmentally responsible public image.

---

## Avoid greenwashing

- Don't pretend scale of environmental impact
- Don't assume all efforts are on the consumer

---

## Sources of carbon emissions (VERY non exhaustive)

- Development cycle: CI/CD automation
- Database and asset storage
- Compute time per request
- Sending resources over-the-wire
- Client-side compute


- How we build our websites
- How we deploy our websites


---

## Debugging

As JS gets better, testing gets... <v-click class=""> worse? ðŸ˜… </v-click>

- Tight coupling = more to simulate

---

## Green hosting

- Not all compute hours are created equal
  - Emissions are often an industry problem far more than an individual problem
  - If you work countless hours to push compute times to zero, it's all pointless if the host is burning coal on each request
